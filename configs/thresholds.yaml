# Policy Engine Thresholds
# Reference: spec/state-vector.md §8
#
# τ_i: weakness threshold per dimension group
# w_group: importance weight per dimension group

thresholds:
  # Offensive Profile (dims 0-3): diversity below 40% needs work
  offensive_profile: 0.4
  # Technique (dims 4-7): below 50% indicates poor form
  technique: 0.5
  # Defense (dims 8-11): defense is critical for safety
  defense: 0.5
  # Rhythm (dims 12-14): below 40% affects combinations
  rhythm: 0.4
  # Conditioning (dims 15-17): fatigue resistance is fundamental
  conditioning: 0.6

group_weights:
  # w_group: importance weight for priority scoring
  defense: 1.5          # Safety first
  technique: 1.2        # Form prevents injury and builds power
  conditioning: 1.0     # Base importance
  offensive_profile: 0.8  # Variety is secondary to execution
  rhythm: 0.8           # Timing improves with other skills

# Minimum confidence to consider a dimension for weakness detection
min_confidence: 0.3
